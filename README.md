# SkynetWebsiteScraper

The Skynet web server is a communal server for members of the University of Limerick
computer society. Each society member is given a home directory on the server and has the
choice of displaying a publically facing webpage.

There are society members from the late 90's all the way to first year students making their first page in 2018.
An interest developed to look at the evolution of web design and at how
the content of webpages existed pre web2.0. At the time of creating the script the skynet server was getting new equipment so there was a risk that not all the data would be transferred. By creating a index of pages one could more easily backup and preserve webpages.

However there was no easily accessible index to see all of the pages and a lot of pages would never have been created or would have lost information over the years I would get a lot of 404's.

So I made a script that allows me to create my own index of my fellow society members websites.
