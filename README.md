# SkynetWebsiteScraper

The Skynet web server is a communal server for members of the University of Limerick
computer society. Each society member is given a home directory on the server and has the
choice of displaying a publically facing webpage.

A common interest among me and my peers is to look at the evolution of web design and even 
the content of webpages.

However there was no easily accessible index to see the pages.

So I made a script that allows me to create my own index of my fellow society members websites.
